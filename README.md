# OpenMP-MPI-and-Hybrid-Parallel-Programming
Leveraged OpenMP, MPI to parallelize basic linear algebra algorithms. Used various techniques to parallelize matrix operations using shared memory model(OpenMP) and message passing interface(MPI) and evaluated timing statistics.

Linear algebra algorithms:
- Vector Addition(1xN matrix addition)
- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Multiplication
